# This application allows user to use their camera and the mediapipe library to replicate life like events on their computer.
## 1. Mouse capability
### The mouse capabilty works my setting an image's coordinates to the cordinates of one of the captured joints in the mediapipe landmarks object it contains x,y,z cordinates of your hand and by using one we can crate a functions that translates the coordianates to the postition of the image. after you get the coordinates the amount of pixels id disproportionate to the screen size so we have to adjust it to the range of our screen. **I can see that it works by the console log output and I made a function that picks a random color if the click works.**
